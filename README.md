# EPUB Reader Comparison

## Summary 
A critical evaluation of two EPUB Readers: [ReadiumJS Viewer](https://github.com/readium/readium-js-viewer) and [Epub.js Reader](https://github.com/futurepress/epubjs-reader/)

## How to Choose? 
NPM's ["How to Choose Between Similar Packages"](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/searching-for-packages#how-to-choose-between-similar-packages) is a helpful start:
<pre>
<b>Popularity</b> indicates how many times the package has been downloaded. This is a
good indicator of packages that others have found to be especially useful, but
not foolproof.

<b>Quality</b> includes considerations such as the presence of a readme file,
stability, tests, up-to-date dependencies, custom website, and code complexity.

<b>Maintenance</b> ranks packages according to the attention given by developers.
Packages that are maintained more frequently are more likely to work well with
the current or upcoming versions of npm, for example.

* How easy would it be to migrate _from_ this library?
* How old is this library?
* When was the most recent activity?
* How many active contributors?
* What is the version number?
	* The presence of a prerelease tag (-alpha, -beta) indicates substantial risk, as does a major number of zero (0.y.z), which is used to indicate a work-in-progress that may contain any level of potentially breaking changes (highest risk).
* How easy is it to integrate this library into my current workflow?
* Is the README well-written? Does the formatting show care?
	* Attention paid to small details is usually a good sign for the big picture, too
